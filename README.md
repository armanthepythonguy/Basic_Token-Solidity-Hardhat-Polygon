# Basic Token Smart Contract

This particular smart contracts have all the basic functionalities of a crypto token. You can mint, transfer, burn it. We have deployed the smart contract in Polygon Testnet :- 0x7A647D098d57F9e4ce51833f626fE7c1b633F517. In this repo, you will be able to find the smart contract and all the important unit tests and deployment files related to this project. This project is built using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) which is an Ethereum Development Kit used to develop smart contracts, and test and deploy them into live networks. Hardhat is a library in NodeJS so we need to code it using JS/Typescript.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install all the important prerequisites. We have package.json and package-lock.json file which stores the name and versions of the prerequisites needed for this project.

```bash
npm install
```

## Enviornment variables
Create a .env file in the parent directory and edit it accordingly
```bash
POLYGON_TEST_RPC_URL = #Your alchemy URL
PRIVATE_POLYGON_TEST_KEY = #Your wallet private key
POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY = #API KEY generated from the block explorer website
```

## Commands 

```bash
npx hardhat compile #This command is used to compile the smart contracts

npx hardhat test #This command is used to run the unit tests on the smart contracts on the local network. It will start a local blockchain in your system and implement tests on the smart contract

npx hardhat run .\scripts\deploy.js #This command is used to deploy the smart contract on the local blockchain

npx hardhat run .\scripts\deploy.js --network networkname #This command is used to deploy the smart contract on a network that we have configured in the hardhat config file.

npx hardhat run .\scripts\deploy.js --network polygonMumbai
